          <p style="font-family: Genshin; color: white; font-style: italic;">The Seven Archons, typically shortened to The Seven, are the seven gods who preside over the seven regions of Teyvat, established after seven gods emerged as the victors of the Archon War 2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an element and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment and determined their method of governance over their regions.</p>
          <p style="font-family: Genshin; color: white; font-style: italic;">Each Archon has an internal magic focus called a Gnosis, which allows them to resonate directly with Celestia. By comparison, Visions are "primitive" â€” though what exactly a Gnosis is capable of, as well as its purpose beyond a symbol of an Archon's godhood, is unknown.</p>
